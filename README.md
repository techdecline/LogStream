# LogStream
PowerShell Module to combine File-based and Command Line-based logging

## Description
This module is meant to be used as way to standardize Log File creation from PowerShell scripts as well as provide 
reasonable logging to the command line. By writing both to the output stream and to file with added datetime information,
logging is consistent.

## How to get the module
You can either download the files on your own from this repository or take a look in the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/LogStream).

## How to contribute
You can both open issues or fork this repository in order to make changes to the project.
